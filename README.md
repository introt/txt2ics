# txt2ics
WIP. A Python library and cli tool to convert text files into ics events and/or calendars

To be built using https://github.com/ics-py/ics-py, the field parser library from introt/zim2anki & maybe Python Fire for the cli - an interactive mode could also be cool.

It's weird that there isn't a tool by this name already: [text2ics](https://github.com/cpg314/scripts) is a dead link, [txt2icssed](https://github.com/azizcodes/azizcodes.github.io/blob/845235a76dec7380a5dd0730e0c64991fc645113/_posts/2018-01-10-txt2icssed.md) uses sed and requires strict formatting, and [txt2ics.js](https://github.com/jeansordes/edt-miage/blob/4673eec3c2c6a2a2b3add34611f78776cd58e5c4/src/ut3/txt2ics.js) is written in a language I'm not too familiar with (pun intended; the comments are in French).
